Currently, web services store user data indefinitely, including sensitive information. This can expose the data to other users of the web service, as well as to attackers or insiders via common web vulnerabilities like SQL injections or compromise of privileged accounts. Edna is a library that helps web applications implement sealing, which removes or dissociates some or all of a user's data, and revealing, which restores the sealed data at a user's request, without breaking the application for other users. Sealing transformations store user data in an encrypted form and make any necessary changes to the application database. Revealing reintroduces the sealed data to the application database.
